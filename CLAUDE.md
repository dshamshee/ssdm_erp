## Server Action Conventions

- Route actions should start with `"use server"`.
- Each action should handle auth/session checks inside the action itself.
- For writes, validate incoming payloads with the route-local Zod schema before database access.
- Keep action return shapes consistent:
  - success: `{ success: true, data }`
  - failure: `{ success: false, message }`
- Catch database or action errors and return a readable `message` string for the client layer.
